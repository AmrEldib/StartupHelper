Startup Helper

Startup Helper is a tiny Windows utility that helps create startup profiles. Here's a quick story that explains what that means:

I use a laptop at work, and I take it home and out when I go to a coffee shop.
There are number of applications that I always use at work: Outlook, Firefox, couple of work applications, and, of course, MetroTwit.
I can detect that I'm at work because the laptop is docked and connected to 2 monitors.
When I go home I don't need my Outlook or work applications.
I can detect that I'm at home by the name of the wireless network I'm connected to.
Same goes for the coffee shop, name of wireless network.
I wanna be able to start few applications based on where I'm, while giving my self a chance to cancel that if it's not the usual day.

This can also become 'Startup Profiles' where I have few applications and documents that I want to start when I'm working on a certain project. But that's for later.

That's the whole thing. Like I said, it's tiny.
